# github-profile-viewer


so basically this mini  project is all about github profile viewer where user will get to know about the info of a certain user such as followers, following, repositories and will get the link to the all the repositories the person had made and it will show all the repositories present in the github profile of the user 


here we have used a basic HTML, css and javascript where data is being executed from the API url  and the informations are being displayed in the document page 

getting started after this .... continue to read the files and try to make it by urself as far as possible
